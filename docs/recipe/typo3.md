Deployer is a free and open source deployment tool written in PHP. 
It helps you to deploy your TYPO3 application to a server. 
It is very easy to use and has a lot of features. 

Three main features of Deployer are:
- **Provisioning** - provision your server for you.
- **Zero downtime deployment** - deploy your application without a downtime.
- **Rollbacks** - rollback your application to a previous version, if something goes wrong.

Additionally, Deployer has a lot of other features, like:
- **Easy to use** - Deployer is very easy to use. It has a simple and intuitive syntax.
- **Fast** - Deployer is very fast. It uses parallel connections to deploy your application.
- **Secure** - Deployer uses SSH to connect to your server.
- **Supports all major PHP frameworks** - Deployer supports all major PHP frameworks.

You can read more about Deployer in [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started.md).

The [deploy](#deploy) task of **TYPO3** consists of:
* [deploy:info](/docs/recipe/deploy/info.md#deploy-info) – Displays info about deployment
* [deploy:setup](/docs/recipe/deploy/setup.md#deploy-setup) – Prepares host for deploy
* [deploy:lock](/docs/recipe/deploy/lock.md#deploy-lock) – Locks deploy
* [deploy:release](/docs/recipe/deploy/release.md#deploy-release) – Prepares release


The typo3 recipe is based on the [common](/docs/reciperecipe/common.md) recipe.
